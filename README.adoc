# Active Directory demo
:toc: left

Active Directory using Samba for demo/test purposes.

Inspired by and based on https://schneide.blog/2022/06/27/running-a-containerized-activedirectory-for-developers/.

Inspired also by https://github.com/samisalkosuo/openldap-docker.

## Use case

Occasionally I have a need to have LDAP (Active Directory) server with groups and users. Thatâ€™s why this container exists. No installations, no setup, just run and use.

## Usage

* Run and generate default self-signed certificate. hostname is used to generate certificate.

```
podman run -it --rm -p 1636:636 -p 1389:389 --hostname ad --name ad kazhar/activedirectory-demo
```

* Run and generate certificate for given host(s)/IP(s).

```
podman run -it --rm -p 1636:636 --hostname ad -e TLS_SAN="localhost ad-demo.sirius.com ad.example.org" -e TLS_IP="127.0.0.1" --name ad kazhar/activedirectory-demo
```

* Run and set your admin password and user password.

```
podman run -it --rm -p 1636:636 --hostname ad -e SAMBA_ADMIN_PASSWORD="C0mpleXp@ssw0rd" -e DEFAULT_PASSWORD=yeahyeah --name ad kazhar/activedirectory-demo
```

* When running the container, you can add your own groups and users using `USERS` environment variable.

```
podman run -it --rm -p 1636:636 --hostname ad -e USERS="staff:user1,user2,user3,user4,user5" --name ad kazhar/activedirectory-demo
```

## USERS-environment variable

Users and group are added using `USERS`-environment variable.

All variables that start with `USERS`, like `USERS_STAFF`,`USERSBLD2` and so on, are used to create groups and users.

Environment variable value can be one of:

* `USERNAME`, user with username as id and uses default password.
** Example: `USERS_GROUP1="group1:user1,user2,user3"`
* `USERNAME=PASSWORD`, user with username as id and uses given password.
** Example: `USERS_GROUP2="group2:user1=pwd1,user2=pwd2,user3=user3pwd"`
* `FIRSTNAME LASTNAME`, user id is generated from first name and last name so that it is first letter of first name combined with last name. Default password is used.
** Example: `USERS_GROUP3="Han Solo,Leia Organa,Ahsoka Tano"`.
** User IDs generated are: `hsolo, lorgana and atano`
* `FIRSTNAME LASTNAME=PASSWORD`, user id is generated from first name and last name so that it is first letter of first name combined with last name. Password is given.
** Example: `USERS_GROUP3="Mara Jade=thehand,Kyle Katarn=jedirebel,Sabine Wren=tobejedi"`
** User IDs generated are: `mjade, kkatarn and swren`.

## LDAP connection and filters

Some applications ask for LDAP connection and filters. If using the default Active Directory demo image, here are the settings and filters that should work.

.LDAP connection settings
|===
|Setting |Value

|URL
|`ldaps://server.ip:1686`

|Base DN
|`dc=sirius,dc=com`

|Bind DN, admin or domain search user
|`Administrator@sirius.com`

|Admin password
|`STRONGpassw0rd`

|User filter
|`(&(sAMAccountName=%v)(objectcategory=user))`

|Group filter
|`(&(cn=%v)(objectcategory=group))`

|Group membership search filter
|`(&(cn=%v)(objectcategory=group))`

|Group member ID map 
|`memberOf:member`

|LDAP group name attribute
|`*:cn`

|LDAP group display name
|`cn`

## Groups and users

Groups and users are specified in link:scripts/config.ini[scripts/config.ini]-file.

One group is:

- `cn=admin,cn=users,dc=sirius,dc=com`

And one user in that group is :

- `cn=kdoyle,cn=users,dc=sirius,dc=com`

The default password for users is `passw0rd`. Another password can be set in using `DEFAULT_USER_PASSWORD` environment variable.

## Certificate

Self-signed certificate is automatically generated. `TLS_SAN` and `TLS_IP` environment variables are used to generate certficate with my CA (https://github.com/samisalkosuo/certificate-authority).

If you want to use your own certificate, you need to copy certificate files to container when building container. See link:Dockerfile[Dockerfile].

Certificate file paths/names must be: 
```
/etc/samba/tls/ca.crt
/etc/samba/tls/tls.crt
/etc/samba/tls/tls.key
```
